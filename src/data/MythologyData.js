Abhimanyu heard and memorized the entire process from inside Subhadra’s womb.But by the time Arjuna told her about coming out of the Chakravyuh, Subhadra fell asleep. As a result, Abhimanyu learned only entering the labyrinth but couldn’t know how to come out of it. Later in life, when young Abhimanyu fought in the great Kurukṣhetra War of Mahabharata, he had to confront the enemy’s Chakravyuh formation. He could get into the formation, but could not come out.Abhimanyu took a chariot wheel and swung it around, fighting enemies unarmed.

Ekalavya then showed him the idol and said, “You are my Guru.” Dronacharya was worried that Ekalavya would become a better archer than Arjuna, Dronacharya’s favorite student.
