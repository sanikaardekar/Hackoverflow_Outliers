EduLearn - Making Learning Easier
Education is an integral part of everyoneâ€™s life. Education refers to the overall development of a kid where he learns not only about the subject matters but also about the way of life.<br>
Education must provide a kid with overall development and not only bookish knowledge. Because of this, there needs to be a focus on various subjects like Maths, Coding, learning values through Mythology, and also Communication skills.<br>
Coding: The user will be able to build and visualize various algorithms and also participate in the contests.<br>
Mythology: Students can view various mythological stories and gain knowledge and values for their personal development. Students can also play crosswords having questions on mythological instances and values and boosting their knowledge.<br>
Maths: Helps students to learn and memorize formulas, since while practising sums and solving problems, procedures are very important. Geogebra helps with various maths calculations and flash cards help to memorize formulas.<br>
Communication: The interview section provides a platform to practice posture for interviews and attempt demo interviews. It also reviews your demo interview to improve your soft skills.<br>
We also provide a calendar and video chat feature where students can schedule events and keep track of their activities. The video chat feature allows direct access to mentors for advice and guidance.<br>
Our platform combines various features to help learn, understand and practise the learnings. Our website can be used by teenagers and adults to learn maths, coding and prepare for public speaking and interviews. The smooth UI ensures user-friendliness. Our application is heavily built on ReactJS and Django Rest framework which are popular and modular tools ensuring scalability and easy maintenance.<br>
